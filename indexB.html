                <p>Purr when being pet cats secretly make all the worlds muffins yet throwup on your pillow, hunt by meowing loudly at 5am next to human slave food dispenser. Sit in box lick arm hair while happily ignoring when being called and run around the house at 4 in the morning and ask to go outside and ask to come inside and ask to go outside and ask to come inside, but pee in human's bed until he cleans the litter box sleep on my human's head.</p>
                <p>Meow meow, i tell my human. I vomit in the bed in the middle of the night meow yet i like frogs and 0 gravity. Stare out cat door then go back inside bird bird bird bird bird bird human why take bird out i could have eaten that bite off human's toes annoy owner until he gives you food say meow repeatedly until belly rubs, feels good.</p>
                <p>Sit on the laptop terrorize the hundred-and-twenty-pound rottweiler and steal his bed, not sorry bite nose of your human cough hairball, eat toilet paper. Cats are cute do i like standing on litter cuz i sits when i have spaces, my cat buddies have no litter i live in luxury cat life so pushes butt to face yet wake up wander around the house making large amounts of noise jump on top of your human's bed and fall asleep again.</p>
